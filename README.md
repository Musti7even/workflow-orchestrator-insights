This was my lovable prompt that crated this project:

"""I am building a company/solutions for companies that automate workforces across some verticals.
The ones I have are:
- Customer Service
- HR
- Financial Analyst

In all off these verticals we have workflows that can be triggered. For example when we receive a new Email to our customer service request email where customer complain or ask about something.
All these things are being handled automatically right now.

However something that is missing is a management platform where we see all processes/entities.
So I want to have entries whenever a workflow is triggered. It should contain the timestamp, what type it is, what the input data is and the status. The status is pending/ongoing usually and at the end of the workflow I will update the status to done with the outcome. So basicalls 2-3 status with pending, failed, completed.

I would store these interactions and their current state in a supabase database. Lets keep it lightweight and quite wide/easy.

The management paltform should have an amzing and well structured UI because we are going to pitch it infront of VC's.

Can you please develop the platform (without auth for me).
Also make sure to add the backend (routes) that I can call with httprequests/webhooks to add a new entry and update the status."""
